    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Preheat the oven to 170°C/325°F/gas 3. Place a
        30cm shallow casserole pan on a high heat, strip in
        the rosemary leaves, add 1 tablespoon of olive oil,
        and crisp up for 1 minute while you dice the lamb
        into 3cm chunks. Scoop out the rosemary and put
        aside, adding the lamb to the pan for 2 minutes to get
        some colour. Meanwhile, squash the olives and
        remove the stones.</p>
        <p>ODrain the pickled onions and stir into the pan with
            the olives. Toss well, then pour in the tinned
            tomatoes, breaking them up with a wooden spoon, as
            well as 2 tins’ worth of water. Cover and cook in the
            oven for 2 hours, or until thick, delicious and tender,
            stirring halfway and loosening with a splash of
            water, if needed. Taste, season to perfection with sea
            salt and black pepper, sprinkle over the crispy
            rosemary leaves, and serve. Simple.</p>
