   <h3>Description</h3>
   <p>Another lamb classic. The one and only lamb chop recipe you'll ever need</p>
    <p><h3>Serves 2 | TOTAL JUST 15 MINUTES</h3></p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>6 lamb chops, French-trimmed (600g total)</li>
        <li>200g mixed-colour baby heritage carrots</li>
        <li>8 cloves of garlic</li>
        <li>3 oranges</li>
        <li>Â½ a bunch of fresh thyme (15g)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Score the fat of the lamb chops, season them with
        sea salt and black pepper, then line them up, like a
        rack, and sit them together fat edges down in a large
        shallow casserole pan on a medium-high heat. Leave
        for 5 minutes to render and crisp up. Trim and add
        the whole baby carrots (halving any larger ones) and
        the unpeeled garlic cloves alongside, turning the
        carrots regularly.</p>
        <p>Gently turn the chops on to their sides, to cook for 2
            minutes on each side, or until golden, but still pink in
            the middle. Meanwhile, use a speed-peeler to peel
            strips of zest from 1 orange. Sprinkle them into the
            pan with the thyme sprigs, and toss it all together for
            just 30 seconds to get the flavours going.</p>
            <p>Remove the chops to a plate to rest, then squeeze the
                juice from all 3 oranges into the pan. Let the juice
                bubble and reduce until sticky, quickly toss the lamb
                back in with its resting juices, then hey presto, time
                to dish up.</p>
