    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <li>400g lean minced beef</li>
        <li>8 heaped teaspoons green pesto</li>
        <li>1 × 400g tin of plum tomatoes</li>

        <li>4 soft burger buns</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Use your clean hands to scrunch the minced beef
        with half the pesto and a pinch of sea salt and black
        pepper. Split into 12 pieces and, with wet hands, roll
        into balls. Brown the balls all over in a non-stick
        frying pan on a high heat with 1 tablespoon of olive
        oil, shaking the pan regularly.</p>
        <p>Once the balls are golden and gnarly, pour in the
            tomatoes, breaking them up with a wooden spoon,
            along with just a quarter of a tin’s worth of water.
            Bring to the boil, slice the mozzarella and lay over
            the balls, pop the lid on and leave to thicken for 5
            minutes on a medium heat. Meanwhile, warm your
            buns in a large dry non-stick frying pan or in the
            oven on a low heat.</p>
            <p>Split each bun and spread 1 heaped teaspoon of pesto
                inside. Divvy up the balls and mozzarella with a
                little sauce, serving the rest on the side for dunking.</p>
